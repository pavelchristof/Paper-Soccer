Paper Soccer
============

The game starts on an empty field of (usually) 8Ã—10 boxes, with goals of two boxes wide marked in the centers of the two shorter sides. In the beginning, a ball is drawn in the center of the field, on the crossing of the paper lines.
Players take turns to move the ball into one of the eight paper line crossings around it (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and a segment from the original position to the new one is drawn to mark the move. The ball may move neither on the game field border nor on the segments marking the previous moves - instead, it "bounces" from them: a player who moves the ball into a position where there is already an end of a segment or a game field border gets another turn.
The first player to place the ball in the opponent's goal wins the game. The game may also end when a player does not have a valid move, in which case that player loses.

Code description (in polish)
============================

In addition to implementing different parts of the contest to communicate with other participants and interpreters , we tried to implement the Min-Max algorithm and even win the artificial intelligence of this game in some conditions.
